## CFG Presentation Takeaway

### What went well?

- I really enjoy CSS and love making things aesthetically pleasing, so it was rewarding to build something that looked like an actual website.

### What were the challenges?

- I struggled with JavaScript until I realized I wasnt linking to my JS files, it was a silly little mistake but it drove me absolutely mad for hours. I also had a harder time with making my website responsive than I was expecting, I feel my code for responsive is very messy and know there must be a better way to do what I was wanting. Also, the navbar gave me some issues. 

### How will you expand your current project?

- I'd like to add more JavaScript and interactive elements to the website. Possibly building out the careers page more as well. And cleaning up my responsive code.
